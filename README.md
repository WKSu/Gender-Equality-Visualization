# Gender Equality Visualization
A project for the EPA1333 Computer Engineering for Scientific Computing course. Data analysis on Sustainable Development Goal 5: Gender Equality.

Foreword: For building this notebook, we have tried to work with and experiment with as many graphs and analyses as possible. 
We used several libraries as will be shown throughout the notebook, and tried to come up with interesting charts and plots. Sometimes this might have been at the cost of the level of the analysis and interpretation, but we put the focus on the coding because this taught us the most.

The scientific contribution of this project is to gain more understanding of mechanisms of human prosperity, by analyzing the causal relations between gender equality and other SDGs. 
The societal contribution is to help policymakers in the achievement of gender equality with the information on these causal relations.
